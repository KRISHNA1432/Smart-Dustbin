# Smart-Dustbin
Developed a smart system for dustbins to generated automated email service for garbage collection using MQTT client Adafruit


MQTT references:

MQTT is a machine-to-machine, Internet of Things connectivity protocol. It is an extremely lightweight publish-subscribe communication model, useful for connections in remote locations where a small code footprint is the order of the day.

MQTT is a telemetry protocol based on on on the publish-subscribe communication model. It was initially developed by IBM and is of OASIS standard now, with the latest release of v3.1.1 in 2013. Formerly, the acronym MQTT stood for MQ Telemetry Transport. This lightweight, open, simple and easy-to-implement protocol is suitable for constrained environments and applicable in M2M and IoT contexts. MQTT tools have a minimal code footprint and allow optimal bandwidth usage. It runs on TCP by default, but can be run on any ordered, loss-less, bi-directional protocol.
